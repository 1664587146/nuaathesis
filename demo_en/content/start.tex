\chapter{QUICK START}

Welcome to \nuaathesis,
a \LaTeX{} thesis template with English support for foreign language college and/or international students.
We assume that you are familiar with writing articles in \LaTeX.

The source code is hosted on \url{https://github.com/nuaatug/nuaathesis},
feedback, issues and pull requests are always welcomed.

\section{Setup \LaTeX{} Environment}

\nuaathesis{} requires some packages which are not included in basic/minimum \LaTeX{} installation.
Here are some tips to install the depended packages:

\begin{itemize}
\item\textbf{Mik\TeX} it will install missing packages when compiling the document, good luck \verb|:)|
\item\textbf{\TeX~Live} you must install the packages listed in \verb|.ci/texlive.pkgs| manually.
You can use \verb|.ci/install.bat| or \verb|.ci/install.sh| to install theses packages.
\end{itemize}

For Windows users, please definitely check out chapter~\ref{chap:win} (in \verb|windows.tex|),
which contains more detailed instructions.

\section{Compile Template}

Run \verb|build.bat| (Windows) or \verb|build.sh| (others),
it will extract the document class and build the document.

Note:
if simplified Chinese fonts are not installed on Windows,
the document \texttt{nuaathesis.pdf} might fail to build,
but the document class \texttt{nuaathesis.cls} should have been extracted.

\section{Compile Thesis}

Before compiling the thesis,
please make sure that the working directory contains following files/directories:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \verb|nuaathesis.cls|: document class;
  \item \verb|nuaathesis.bst|: biber style;
  \item \verb|logo/|: folder, contains some figures for cover and header.
\end{itemize}
If any of them is missing, please copy it from the root directory of the template.

There are a bunch of methods to compile a \LaTeX{} document,
assuming your thesis is called \verb|master.tex|
\begin{itemize}
\item the recommended compiling command is
\begin{shell}
latexmk -xelatex master
\end{shell}
\item the regular, decoupled compiling commands are
\begin{shell}
xelatex master
bibtex master
xelatex master
xelatex master
\end{shell}
\item you could replace \verb|xelatex| with any other \LaTeX{} engines supported by \CTeX,
but \XeLaTeX{} works best with Chinese document,
and we don't test compatibility with other \LaTeX{} engines except \XeLaTeX.
\end{itemize}

\section{Write/modify Thesis}

This document is also written with \nuaathesis,
why not adapt it into your thesis and save time for starting from scratch?
Here is the list of files that you need to modify:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \verb|master.tex|: the main document
  \item \verb|global.tex|: basic information for cover and abstract, import packages, define macros
  \item \verb|content/|: main matters are here
  \item \verb|bib/|: biber database
\end{itemize}

\section{Disclamer}

This is UNOFFICIAL \LaTeX{} thesis template for NUAA.
Since format specification on English thesis has never been published,
nor has this template received official certification,
there is the risk that the thesis format might not be accepted.

The story is almost the same as the Chinese ones.
We do our best to match \nuaathesis{} with (the only Chinese) official Word template,
but we cannot provide any guarantee for the correct format.
